# Introduction

-   The repo was set up to backup my markdown notes written by typora

-   If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me

## Theme of typora

-   My typora css file [github-night-dimmed.css](https://github.com/Jxpro/MD_Repo/blob/main/github-night-dimmed.css) is **modified** by myself based on [Github-Night](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Github-Night/) in **official** theme website

## Command in Codeblock

There is a blank line between each command without `$`, except in the following cases:

-   If the commands are strongly related, there will be no blank lines between them
-   If this command has critical output, it will be preceded by `$`, and displays the output
